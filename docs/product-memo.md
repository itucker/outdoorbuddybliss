# Product Memo — OutdoorBuddyBliss (Draft)

## One-line summary
OutdoorBuddyBliss helps outdoor enthusiasts discover, book, and share curated local outdoor experiences with simpler planning and better social coordination.

## Problem
- Enthusiasts spend too much time researching routes, permissions, and gear.
- Coordinating friends and sharing real-world trip plans is fragmented across apps.
- Local businesses struggle to reach outdoor customers with curated offerings.

## Target users
- Weekend hikers and day-trip planners (18–55)
- Small guided-tour operators and local outfitters
- Friend groups who organize outdoor activities

## Proposed solution
A web & mobile-first product that:
- Curates nearby trails, experiences, and vetted guides
- Lets users create trip plans, invite friends, and manage equipment/checklists
- Provides a marketplace/connectivity layer for small operators

## Key benefits
- Faster trip planning
- Improved safety & preparedness (checklists, route info)
- Revenue channel for local operators

## Success metrics (first 6 months)
- DAUs/MAUs ratio >= 20%
- Average trip plans created per week ≥ 0.5 per active user
- Conversion rate for bookings via platform ≥ 3%
- Partner onboarding: 25 local operators in pilot city

## High-level timeline (MVP)
- Month 0–1: Product discovery, partner outreach, basic UX flows
- Month 2–3: Core planning + invite + basic listings
- Month 4: Pilot launch in first city, measure key metrics

## Risks & mitigation
- Supply density: focus on a single pilot city initially
- Legal / permitting: surface official route info and user disclaimers
- Trust: curated partner vetting and reviews

## Asks / Next steps
- Confirm pilot city and initial user acquisition channel
- Approve MVP scope for development sprint
