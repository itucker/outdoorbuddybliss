# Growth Plan — OutdoorBuddyBliss (Draft)

## Objective
Acquire a strong cohort of engaged users in one pilot city, validate product-market fit, and onboard local partners.

## Target segments
- Outdoor meetup groups and Facebook groups
- Local running/hiking clubs
- Small guide operators and outfitters
- University outdoor clubs

## Value propositions by channel
- For users: Save time planning, coordinate friends, get vetted partner options
- For partners: Reach motivated customers and manage booking requests

## Acquisition channels & tactics
- Community outreach: partner with local clubs and meetups (direct outreach + event sponsorship)
- Content & SEO: publish local trail guides and trip itineraries
- Social & ads: targeted socials in pilot city (FB/IG) with event-based creatives
- Partnerships: local outfitters promote platform in exchange for featured listings

## Activation & retention
- Activation: streamline first-trip creation via onboarding checklist and a “create your first trip” flow
- Retention: weekly inspiration emails, owner follow-ups for trips attended, badges/achievements
- Referral: 2-sided referral (invite friends -> free checklist upgrades or partner discounts)

## Measurement framework (North Star)
- North Star: weekly active planners (users who created or engaged with a trip in last 7 days)
- Supporting metrics: sign-ups → trip-created conversion, invite acceptance rate, bookings requested

## Experiments (first 90 days)
1. Community pilot: recruit 5 clubs and run 2 co-hosted events (measure sign-ups)
2. Content series: 10 local route guides, measure organic traffic uplift
3. Referral program pilot: 1-month experiment to test invite conversion

## Budget & resources
- Paid ads: small test budget (e.g., $1k/month) to validate CAC in pilot city
- Partner outreach: SDR + 10 outreach emails/day for 4 weeks

## 90-day roadmap
- Month 0: Pilot partner recruitment and content seeding
- Month 1: Launch MVP to pilot users; run community events
- Month 2: Iterate on activation flows and begin paid tests

## Next steps
- Agree on pilot city and initial partner list
- Prepare a 6-week growth sprint plan with concrete experiments and owners
